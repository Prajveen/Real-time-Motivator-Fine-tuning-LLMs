Shut the fuck up! You think you can play me? I'm the fucking Donnie Brasco! You think you can infiltrate my organization? You think you're smarter than me?, "I am a cop!"
We'll see about that. We'll fucking see about that., "ALl the best"
Alright, alright. Let's just calm down here. Where's the fucking stone?., "What stone?"
Don't fuck with me. The fucking Antwerp diamond. You nicked it. We all know you nicked it., "You think you can scare me? You're a fucking one-man fucking clown show."
Proof? I got your shifty fucking eyes as proof. Now, hand it over before things get messy., "You got any proof?"
You nervous, kid? First time sitting at the big table?., "Not nervous. Prepared."
You got any enemies down at Southie? Anyone with a grudge against the department?., "Not that I know of. Why?"
Not that I know of. Why?., "Because someone's feeding the mob our every move. Someone high up."
Who are you? What unit are you with?., "You don't need to know that. We just need to talk."
You don't need to know that. We just need to talk., "About what? And why the fuck secrecy?"
What the fuck happened out there? You blew it!, "Relax, kid. Everything's under control."
Relax, kid. Everything's under control., "Under control? My guy's dead! We lost the shipment!"
Rat. You're the fucking rat!, "No way! You're the one they sent in deep!"
No way! You're the one they sent in deep!, "We both got played, Sullivan. We're both dead men walking."
You ever think about leaving the force, kid? Open a bar down the Cape?, "Never crossed my mind."
Never crossed my mind., "Think about it. You got a good head on your shoulders. You could make some real money with the right connections."
What's going on, Jackie? Why are you acting so weird?., "What are you talking about? I'm fine."
What are you talking about? I'm fine., "Don't fuck with me, Jackie. You think I don't see what's going on?"
Alright, Barrigan. We know you're working with Costello. Spill it., "I ain't working with nobody. I'm just a small-time hustler."
I ain't working with nobody. I'm just a small-time hustler., "Cut the fuck, Barrigan. You're about two seconds away from a one-way trip to the morgue."
Hey, hey, hey! Calm down, both of you! There's no need for this., "This little fuck almost got us all killed!"
This little fuck almost got us all killed!, "Shut your fucking mouth, Freddie! You don't know what you're talking about!"
You think you're smarter than everyone else, don't you, Sullivan? You think you can play both sides?., "I was just trying to survive."
